    Their honeymoon was an unforgettable mix of wild mountain biking near Moab and a thrilling 3-day white water rafting trip on the Colorado River. Over time, they embraced extreme sports such as parasailing and ice climbing, believing that a shared sense of adventure is the key to a strong and lasting marriage.
