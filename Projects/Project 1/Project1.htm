<h2>Answers:</h2>

<p>My first impression of this site was that there was a lot things just on the home page alone. From latest articles, reviews, and ads running, there is a lot to take in and focus on.</p>

<p>Because there is so much information listed on the site, flow of information is very important. For this site "The Latest" articles are listed on the right hand side, while different interviews and other news are on the other half of the page. You are able to scroll down on the homepage quite a bit, and it reveals that bits of each option in the menu are available to see.</p>

<p>The site structure confused me and was displeasing to navigate. I felt that there was too much information on the homepage. I didn't feel the need to explore the rest of the site after viewing the homepage alone.</p>

<p>I can feel what the creators of this site were trying to accomplish by having different graphics and multimedia, but it detracts from the site. It felt overwhelming to navigate the site. Perhaps if there was less going on, the site would be more visually pleasing.</p>

<p>The homepage loaded very quickly. The load time was extremely reasonable. </p>

<p>The text color was readable, but in some places the text size was a bit small. There were no background images, but the background color was white. I found that having a plain background enhanced the site by keeping the background plain, making it easier to read text.</p>

<p>The site had both a navigation bar at the top of the homepage and menu button in the top left hand corner of the page. This site's navigation was well done.</p>

<p>The site had the same color scheme throughout all of the pages. A white background and images were used throughout the site to pair with the text used. The feel of the site was the same on each page.</p>

<p>The site responded well to viewing in a smaller window size. The con to viewing in a smaller window was having to scroll down a considerable amount to get to the bottom of each page.</p>

<p>I found it was unusual to have all of the pages that were listed on the site to appear at the top of the page and in the menu section in the top left corner. The exact same information is listed twice near each other on the site.</p>
