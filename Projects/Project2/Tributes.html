<h1>Tributes for Extreme Honeymoons</h1>

<h2>Brian &amp; Kitty's Memorable Experience</h2>
<p>I'm Brian Jones. My wife Kitty and I were just married last winter. We wanted a memorable honeymoon experience, so we looked into the excursions offered by Extreme Honeymoons. Something I always wanted to do was bow hunt. We were surprised that a cougar hunt was available the week just after our wedding. It was great to have all the details of this trip taken care of by professionals who knew just what was needed. The owners even provided some archery instruction before the trip began.</p>
<p>We met our hunt leader, Tom Henry, on the first day. He runs a team of four hound dogs when he hunts cougars. The hunt began just after a light snow, so the big cats could be tracked. We saw three cougars that day, but were not able to get any clean shots. It was a tiring, exciting, and beautiful weekend.</p>
<p>Thanks for the memories,</p>
<p>Brian and Kitty Jones</p>

<h2>David &amp; Mary's Heliskiing Adventure</h2>
<p>We just wanted to thank Extreme Honeymoons for a rip-roaring time during our honeymoon trip. I had always wanted to try heliskiing, and my honeymoon seemed as good a time to go for it. Both my wife Mary and I are experienced downhill skiers, but we had never tried extreme skiing or snowboarding before.</p>
<p>It was wonderful to rely on your expert team of pilots and guides to make this dream come true. We were lucky to have fresh powder snow the weekend we booked the trip. Extreme Honeymoons even captured great photos of our adventure. Kings Peak is the tallest peak in Utah, and it was amazing to say we skied it. We managed six runs a day—each one an adventure. Although I was worried about our equipment, our guide double-checked everything and we had no issues.</p>
<p>We will tell all our friends about this great way to spend a honeymoon. Thanks for handling every detail so we could simply enjoy the experience.</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>
<p>David and Mary Farnsworth</p>

<h2>Peter &amp; Polly's Mountain Biking Journey</h2>
<p>Who would have thought you could spend your honeymoon having the adventure of your life? I wanted to give my new wife, Louise, an exciting honeymoon. I have been riding mountain bikes for about five years. Both Louise and I are in good shape, so the mountain biking trip over the red rocks of Moab was the perfect adventure for us.</p>
<p>The bed and breakfast inn in Moab was great. We had an early breakfast and then were transferred—with our equipment and a light lunch—to the trail head. We were provided with a map and GPS receiver, and we were off. Although the day was hot (about 90 degrees), we had plenty of water and never felt stressed. Every time we look at our photos from that weekend, we remember the wonderful time we had. The cost was reasonable, and we could never have done this without your help.</p>
<p>Thanks for the time of our lives,</p>
<p>Peter and Polly Renquist</p>
